ABOUT

Chrodic is a Chrome Extension which provides a mouse over text translation
functionality into your browser. Currently it supports translation from English
to Japanese based on the Eijiro dictionary. Because it imports an Eijiro
dictionary file into an IndexedDB inside Chrome, it works fast and also works
offline.


INSTALL

1. Get an Eijiro dictionary file. You can either buy a book which comes with a
   CD containing a dictionary file, or buy a file online at www.eijiro.jp

2. Convert the dictionary file into utf-8. Type this command in your terminal:

   $ iconv -c -f SJIS -t UTF-8 EIJI-118.TXT > EIJI-118-utf-8.TXT

3. Import the dictionary file into Chrome.

   3.1. Go to chrome://extensions in Chrome.
   3.2. Click on the "Options" link on chrodic. It takes you to the Chrodic
        options page.
   3.3. Open JavaScript Console in the options page. Import progress will be
        shown there.
   3.3. In the options page, click on "Choose File" button, select the
        EIJI-118-utf-8.TXT file you just created.
   3.4. Wait until "Done!" is shown on JavaScript Console.

left mouse button more than 500ms. Then Chrodic will start showing translation
of words which are under your mouse. To disable Chrodic simply click on the
